# Stock market prediction using clustering

Stock market is one of the most dynaminc and volatile source of data. The data is genereated every second as the money never sleeps. The change in the values of stocks are a result of various measures and sentiments of the people. In this project, I've tried to cluster the stocks of National Stock Exchange (NSE) India in Top gains and Loosers over a period of time.

# Future Work
* Implementation of twitter sentiment analysis using Neural networks for the specific stock listed.
* Implement the prediction parallaly for each stock to steed up the process
* Apply cuckoo algorithm to find the best apprached prediction thread.
